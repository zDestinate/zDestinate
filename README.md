### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! I'm a full stack web developer and a software engineer. I'm currently a freelance software engineer from NYC. I want to become a cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is really challenging and it push me to my limit which make me able to gain more knowledgede. People that created a crypter, anti-malware, reverse engineer tools, and a bunch of security tools, they make me see thing differently and inspire me to learn more.<br><br>
